## Introduction

[1] This strategy collection will cover a compact, comprehensive and constructive overview of tactics to improve our sleep quality, as well as reduce the time it takes to fall asleep.  As with the other tactic collections, for each tactic a brief introduction will be given, as well as the benefits of the particular tactic and lastly how we can implement it in our lives. <mark>* (* this tackles part of the “you cannot derive an ought from an is” problem that David Hume pointed out, which partially implies that by merely knowing a fact, it does not imply we know how to implement that fact in our lives. A second part which relates to Buddhism more is that we might know why something might be useful to us, but it’s a lower degree of wisdom than having lived and experienced it, for then we not only know but also feel the (dis)advantages it carries along.)</mark>

[2] Just to give a brief definition, ‘poor sleep’ is regarded as sleeping too little or too much, having difficulty falling asleep as well as having a difficulty maintaining sleep. ‘Good  sleep’ can be considered when we are sleeping approximately the right amount for us, falling asleep quickly and generally being able to stay asleep during the night.

<mark>Limitations --> reductionism; emergence principle; disclaimer: listen to our own body and soul; not all strategies will be applicable to all of us e.g. if we are a night shift worker; don’t even need most of the strategies for already a decent sleep quality.</mark>

## Why is this strategy collection important for us?

[3] Sleep is a natural way for our body to rest and regenerate, leading to restored
performance capabilities. In general, one of the most valuable aspects of improving the quality of our sleep is that it leads to a higher life satisfaction (1).  A higher quality sleep improves our mood and reduces the chance of for example anxiety disorders (2). Better sleep is also linked to a lower chance of getting heart disease (3)(4), type 2 diabetes (5), depression (6), obesity (7)(8)(9), different types of cancer (10)(11)(12) and our chances of getting a stroke (4)(13)(14). Furthermore, improved sleep leads to higher cognitive performance, like improving our reaction time (15), our attention, decision making, as well as our working and long-term memory (16). People who generally tend to procrastinate do this less so when having a high quality sleep (18).

[4] It is therefore reasonable that we all can benefit from better sleep, as it improves our life satisfaction, our performance and health in general (1)(17), which leads us to get into an upward spiral more and more as we have a better mood, make fewer mistakes, and have a lower chance of different types of disease.

## 1. General Tips

[5] An overview of the benefits related to sleep of some of the most common keystone habits and important areas of our lives will follow below. Keystone habits and improving in the generally important areas of our lives automatically improve other areas as well, leading to our progress turning into an upward spiral.

#### 1.1 Increasing our life satisfaction/purpose

###### Intro:

[6] If you feel like you are doing exactly what you should be doing, or if you are done working very hard on something you kept putting off but finally tackle it, you tend to fall asleep fast that day as you can feel amongst others exhausted, proud, happy and with a relieved mind or any combination of those. Therefore trying to experience such days more often is highly valuable for yourself and your sleep quality, where you feel that at the end of the day, you put yourself and your surroundings in a (much) better position than at the start of the day.

###### Why:

[7] Even though a lot of benefits of improving your life satisfaction seem to be intuitive, we will not go much deeper in the wide variety of benefits here, as this will be the topic of the <mark>Tactic Collection – Life Satisfaction</mark> instead.

[8] Here we will note some of the benefits of a higher life satisfaction related to your sleep. It leads to having lower chance of getting sleep disorders during midlife (1), especially when low life satisfaction is expressed in a depressed mood (2). Still, a higher degree of dissatisfaction with your life does not seem to necessarily contribute to worse sleep quality (3).

###### How:

[9] Even though the <mark>Tactic Collection – Life Satisfaction</mark> will focus more specifically on the strategies that you might want to use to, we will sum up some important factors
here as well.

[10] One of the crucial aspects about life satisfaction is setting up your life in such a way that it resonates with who you truly are and would love to be. One of the most constructive ways to redirect your life in this direction, is to open up a very honest conversation with yourself. Dare to observe what you are fearful off and confront it voluntarily. The greatest steps forward you could possibly achieve is by overcoming and tackling the issues you somewhere deep down inside of you know that should be done. Carrying out this honest self forward and speaking out truthfully to your environment will also remove a lot of the frictions and
frustrations that might have evolved in your life. You will also grant everyone the possibility to experience and enjoy a fuller version of your true being.

[11] The second and last strategy covered here about improving your life satisfaction which is quite powerful is exercising gratefulness. This is consciously trying to look
at the things that are really positive to you in your life. Sometimes you experience this involuntarily by temporarily missing the things you value, for example when you are ill you miss your health, or not having the possibility to drink water from the tap when traveling across the world. Looking at anything in your life from different perspectives by
for example listening to people with vastly different life stories or by meditating can aid in this process.

#### 1.2 Stabilize our 24-hour cycle

###### Intro:

[12] All humans have a 24 hour cycle in our body that regulates a lot of our behavior and processes in our body. This cycle is also called the circadian rhythm. It makes sense that since a day lasts 24 hours, that this cycle within us also lasts approximately 24 hours (1). As humans live all across the world, where it is light at different times than on other places of the planet, it should be no surprise that there is no absolute baseline circadian rhythm (2).

###### Why:

[13] Humans in general prefer a certain degree of stability in
their lives. Our body is no exception to this. This natural tendency for our body to create a balance is also called homeostasis. Since sleep influences our body, our body therefore prefers a stable circadian rhythm as a way to improve health and overall well-being (3).

###### How:

[14] In order to stabilize your biological 24-hour cycle, it is best to go to bed at around the same time every day, as often as possible. We understand that this will not be
always possible, but you do yourself a favor by trying to make it as stable as possible. You will notice that you automatically will get sleepy around the time you go to bed, which is a clear sign that your body has adjusted to that
daily rhythm. Similarly, try to wake up around the same time every day, as often as possible. At some point you will notice that you will automatically wake up just before your alarm goes off.

**(3) [Overview of Circadian Rhythms](https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh25-2/85-93.htm)**

#### 1.3 Sleep during night, awake during the day

###### Intro:

[15] Humans are daytime creatures – with day versus night being characterized when it is light versus dark outside. Our circadian rhythm is therefore strongly influenced by the amount of light we receive, so that we feel awake during the day and tired when it is dark (1)(2).

###### Why:



[16] Once our body notices that it is getting dark outside, it triggers a part of the brain called the pineal gland, to start producing the sleep hormone called melatonin (3)(4)(5). When our body then notices that it is getting light outside, we tend to wake up (2). This phase of waking up is facilitated by the production of cortisol (6). Working together with this natural circadian cycle and the sleep and waking hormones that come with
it obviously improves your sleep quality.

###### How:

[17] This strategy is self-explanatory by the rule itself.

#### 1.4 Exercise and naturally moving around

###### Intro:



[18] Especially before the Neolithic Revolution, when humans were hunters and gatherers, all of us were naturally outside for a large part of the day and moving around a lot. Therefore it is likely that we were made to move around much more than a lot of us do right now. This Tactic Collection will not go too deeply in the area of naturally moving around and exercise, as this will be covered in the Tactic Collection –Movement. It should be noted that when you do not participate in the current ‘normal’ sedentary lifestyle, as well as the often seen lack of exercise, your overall health improves as well as having a lower chance of getting chronic diseases (1).

###### Why:



[19] Exercise improves the quality of sleep as well the duration of sleep (2). The relationship also works the other way around, as an improved sleep quality improves your exercise performance (3). This implies that we can help ourselves in a positive upward spiral which will benefit not only our exercise routine and sleep quality, but also all the direct and indirect positive effects that each of these two important fields of
our lives provide us with. This is why exercise and sleep are considered to be keystone habits, as the benefits lead to other areas of our lives being improved as a  consequence. Also the willingness to improve other areas of our lives is higher as a consequence.

[20] One specific consequence of the improved sleep quality that 150 minutes of normal to intense exercise per week provides us with, is that people report to feel much less sleepy during the day (4).

###### How:



[21] The Tactic Collection - Movement will cover strategies on how to get yourself moving more. The most important aspect to note is that you should look for any sports or active activity that you truly enjoy, as this is obviously much more fun as well as improves the chance of keep on exercising sports.

[22] With respect to naturally moving around, if you sit a lot behind a computer, try to
make sure that you have it in a default position where you stand up when you are working it (adding music that you enjoy helps, as it will make you move around and make the standing less straining, especially when you are not used to it yet).

#### 1.5 Go outside during the day

###### Intro:



[23] Humans are currently classified in the tree of life as the Homo sapiens. As we have been evolving over tens of thousands of years, we were always surrounded by nature
for the majority of time. It then makes sense that our bodies are adapted to and fit well in natural environments. Due to the urbanization and the artificial nature of many aspects of our current lives, many of us spend much less time outdoors and within nature than what is optimal for us to do so.

###### Why:



[24] The start of melatonin production in the evening happens earlier if you expose yourself to the sun or very bright artificial light earlier in the day (1). The earlier this production starts in the evening, the easier it is to fall asleep (1). Since the light we experience from a sunny summer day can be a thousand times as bright as what we generally experience indoors, going outside from time to time is very important for our melatonin level and the circadian rhythm in general (1)(2). The production of serotonin – which is converted in melatonin when it gets dark (see tactic 1.3) – is increased as well (2). Serotonin has a wide variety of other advantages such as improved mood, social
interactions and decreasing the chance of physical and mental health complications to name a few (2).

###### How:



[25] Since the benefit with respect to sleep of being outside is greatest in the morning, we will mainly focus on implementing going outside in the morning. Therefore it is
advised to reframe a few routine morning activities by doing them outside, especially if you are indoors for the majority of the day. If you do not have a morning routine, we can highly recommend implementing one. For additional information on implementing a morning routine, please check the Tactic Collection – Habits. Activities that can be done outside in the morning include exercising, having breakfast, meditation and journaling.



[26] Another advice is that if you do not go outside so often, do not wear sunglasses to capture more of the positive effects of natural daylight (1). There are also ´bright light lamps´ (see tactic 4.5) you can buy which are specifically designed to improve the light exposure which you can use indoors (2).

#### 1.6 Boost melatonin building blocks

###### Intro:



[27] All humans need to sleep and rest in order to function properly on a regular basis. In order to facilitate the process of knowing when to sleep and be awake, the body produces a hormone called melatonin that helps our body know when it is dark, and nudges us to become sleepy and fall asleep (see tactic 1.5).

[28] Important note: looking at this hormone in particular is a severe form of reductionism – likely much more so than many of the other tactics–. This is because it does not consider the interaction of the body and all its processes with this particular
hormone. Still, in order to provide a general direction for potential improvement, it is included in the overview. This is partially why we strongly advise to not add readily-made supplements of melatonin to your diet, as you would externalize it, leading to a lower inner production of the hormone and then perhaps becoming dependent on the supplement.

###### Why:



[29] As mentioned in tactic 1.3, melatonin production is an important factor in regulating our circadian rhythm and signaling to our body when it is dark, as its production starts when it gets dark. As we have seen in tactic 1.5, the earlier the onset of melatonin, the more easily you will fall asleep. When taking additional melatonin, it has been shown to lower your motor activity, make you more tired as well as decrease your body temperature, three specific traits that occur to fall asleep more easily (1). The benefits of a lower body temperature to fall asleep is discussed in tactic 3.4.4. Melatonin also makes your skin age less quickly, so you look younger for a longer time (2). It can aid in fighting autoimmune disease (3) and neurodegenerative processes (4) and can be helpful for losing weight (5).

###### How:



[30] Many of the tactics mentioned throughout this tactic collection have a direct or indirect effect that promote the production of melatonin, like tactic 1.3 – sleeping during the night, tactic 1.5 – going outside during the day, and tactic 2.1 – applying blue light filters to your electronics. Also, since the neurotransmitter and hormone serotonin is converted in melatonin when your environment becomes dark (see tactic 1.3), we will focus on the building blocks of serotonin production (and therefore melatonin). This will then increase the signaling potency of the hormone in your body, as you will increase the amount of hormones that can be produced inside your body.

*[31] It is possible to increase your serotonin by exposing yourself to bright light (see tactic 1.5). Another strategy to raise the amount of serotonin is to exercise (6), as it amongst others increases the amount of tryptophan in your system - which is a building block of serotonin (42)(43)(44). A more subjective form of implementation is your capacity to regulate your own mood (45).*

*[32] There are also a variety of foods that increase the amount of melatonin in your body (42). The animal foods that include a higher amount of melatonin are fish and eggs. The plant foods that contain a higher proportion of melatonin include nuts, seeds, sprouting vegetables, tart Montmorency cherries, certain mushrooms and cereals (46)(47)(#)(##). The Tactic Collection – Nourishment contains some baseline overviews of which foods to include in your diet, as well as the foods that boost your melatonin as well.*

###### Intro:



If it is absolutely necessary for you to work during the night, apply the
knowledge about light and its effect on your circadian rhythm by exposing
yourself to bright light during your night shift and to complete darkness
during the day. This shift will also improve both alertness and cognitive
performance during your night shift (10).
