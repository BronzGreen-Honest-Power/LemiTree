## **Intro**
[//]: <> (BO-intro)
unscreen is a vital tool in the fight against skin damage, particularly that caused by the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. Available in various forms such as creams, lotions, sprays, and gels, sunscreen contains active ingredients that either absorb, reflect, or scatter UV radiation. By doing so, it helps to protect the skin from sunburn, premature aging, and skin cancers such as melanoma. Sunscreen is an essential part of daily skin care for many people, especially those who spend significant time outdoors or live in sun-intense regions. Its use is recommended by dermatologists and healthcare professionals worldwide as a simple yet effective measure to promote skin health and prevent long-term damage.

## **Why**
[//]: <> (BO-why)


### *Benefit 1*
By preventing the development of skin conditions such as actinic keratoses, squamous cell carcinomas, nevi, and melanomas, there is a reduced risk of skin-related diseases.(https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(16)30880-5/fulltext)
### *Benefit 2*
Through the minimization of DNA damage in skin cells, both skin aging and damage can be reduced, resulting in positive aesthetic effects on the skin's appearance. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34387824/)
### *Benefit 3*
Does not have a negative impact on the production of Vitamin D. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31069787/).

## **How**
[//]: <> (BO-how)
To ensure effective protection, an adult needs about 30-40 mL of sunscreen. Most often, the protective products are applied too thinly and effectively reach only 20-30% of the sun protection factor (Source Amboss).
