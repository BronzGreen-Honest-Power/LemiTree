### **Intro**
[//]: <> (BO-intro)
Caffeine is the most widely used central nervous system stimulant in the world (1). This implies it generally increases our alertness, attention, energy and physical activity (2). This might also be one of the primary reasons it is consumed so much. The most known drinks and food that include caffeine are coffee, certain types of tea, energy drinks, mat√©, soft drinks like cola and cacao products. Intuitively, the effects of caffeine stand in direct opposition to our degree of sleepiness. This is why it is important to try to limit the consumption of caffeine as much as possible to the early hours of the day.

### **Why**
[//]: <> (BO-why)
Even though caffeine can be really useful to improve our performance in the day, if it affects our sleep badly, it can become counterproductive. Even if you go to bed 6 hours after having had your last coffee, it will still negatively influence your sleep quality (3). This is because it takes time for our body to break down the caffeine. The time it takes for half of the caffeine we consume to be broken down can last from 1.5 to 9.5 hours, with a half-life on average of around five hours (4)(5).

### **How**
[//]: <> (BO-how)
- Limit the use of products containing caffeine during the last 6-12 hours before you go to bed.
- An easy rule of thumb is to only consume products containing caffeine in the morning.
- Some of the noted products are recommended to quit consuming altogether, like energy drinks and soft drinks. This is because of a variety of ingredients that are harmful to us.
