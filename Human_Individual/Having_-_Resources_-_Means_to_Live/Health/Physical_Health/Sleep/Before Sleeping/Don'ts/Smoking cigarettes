### **Intro**
[//]: <> (BO-intro)
Smoking has a wide array of direct and indirect issues that are related to it. We are all aware of many of the negative effects of smoking cigarettes. These include but are not limited to worsening vision (source), less sense of smell and taste (source), higher chance of lung cancer (source), higher chance of blood pressure (source), stroke & heart attack due to restricting blood vessels (source), increased chance for miscarriage and if born, still puts the baby at increased risk for other developmental disorders and death (source). Smoking cigarettes also decreases your sleep quality (1)(2). There are also often positive habits linked to the act of smoking. Examples include deep inhaling which is calming (source), going outside which provides fresh air (source), it induces us to walk around which activates our body (source), as well as a rebellious vibe (source) and social dimension (source). This makes it an especially tough habit to let go off. Click on [Habits & Addictions] () and [Smoking cigarettes]() for more information.

The beneficial effects of quitting smoking related to sleep can be different for males and females.

### *Benefit 2*
Non-smokers also have a lower chance of getting sleep disorders (2).

### *Benefit 3*
For women, quitting smoking is associated with feeling more awake during the day and for men, not smoking decreases the chance of having nightmares (2).
