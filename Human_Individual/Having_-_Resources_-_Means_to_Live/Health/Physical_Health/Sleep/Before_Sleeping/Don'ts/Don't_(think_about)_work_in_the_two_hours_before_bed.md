In the two hours before bed, it is recommended to not be engaged with your daily work. This is because rest is an essential part of productivity, as we recover our capacity to work while we are resting. As sleep is our daily moment of rest, it is good to allow your body and brain to disengage and relax in the hours before bed. This is why it is recommended to not (think about) work in the two hours before you go to bed. Instead, do anything that helps you relax or that you enjoy, especially when work is not that enjoyable to you.

### *Close off anything related to work*
* Close off the brain by writing down everything that comes up as an idea or worry about your work and leave it for tomorrow.
* Close off visual triggers by not entering your work environment anymore.
* Close off visual triggers by changing from your work clothes to your chilling clothes.
* Don't use any tools that you use during work. In case of your phone - see if you can split between a work phone and a private phone. The same holds for your email.
* Engage in any relaxing activity in these hours that you enjoy doing. For inspiration look at [[Wind-down Ritual]].
