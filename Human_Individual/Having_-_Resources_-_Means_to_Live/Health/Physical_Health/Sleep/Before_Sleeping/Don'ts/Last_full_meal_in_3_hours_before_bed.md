### **Intro**
[//]: <> (BO-intro)
Having a steady food rhythm is important for our body's circadian rhythm. The timing of your last meal is important for your sleep quality as well. It is not recommended to go to bed hungry but we also shouldn't eat just before going to bed. The ideal time to eat your last full meal is approximately three to four hours before you go to bed.

### **Why**
[//]: <> (BO-why)
### *Benefit 1*
Not eating a large meal before bed can decrease the chances of getting obesity (1).

### *Benefit 2*
Small snacks with a lot of nutrients and a low amount of energy can be beneficial for your health (1).

### *Benefit 3*
The chance of stomach acid splashing up your throat is also reduced when we do not eat a full meal in the three hours before going to bed (2).

### *Benefit 4*
A second aspect to eating close before bed is that it requires effort for our body to process food. This causes blood to flow to our metabolism which is an activating activity (source [todo]). It also causes the body temperature to raise (source [todo]). This in turn decreases our sleep quality.

### *Benefit 5*
Eating three to four hours before bed decreases the chance of snacking just before bed (source [todo]).

## **How**

### *Instruction 1*
If you have little restrictions in the last four to five hours before bed, this tactic is easy.

### *Instruction 2*
If you work until shortly before bed, look at __Mealprepping__ (link) or __Food delivery__ (link) for bringing good food (with you) to your work.
