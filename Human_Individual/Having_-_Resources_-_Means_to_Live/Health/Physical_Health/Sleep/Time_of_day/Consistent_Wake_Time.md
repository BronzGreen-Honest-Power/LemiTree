## **Intro**

To a certain degree, we enjoy predictability and certainty. Our body does so as well. Waking up at the same time every is one such form of predictability. You might start to notice this habit by sometimes waking up one or two minutes before the alarm goes off.

## **Why**
[//]: <> (BO-why)
Waking up at the same time every day is one of the most successful ways to waking up easily. Combined with a sufficient amount of [sleeping hours]() and you create yourself one of the most successful ways of waking up quickly and well-rested. When we create more predictability in our wake time, we trade a daily dose of extra energy and waking up more easily for more fragility. This implies that once we get used to waking up at the same time every day, deviating becomes increasingly difficult and leads to increased sleepiness. Therefore be mindful whether your situation allows you to easily uphold this habit, because then it is wonderful to enjoy this extra daily dose of energy.
