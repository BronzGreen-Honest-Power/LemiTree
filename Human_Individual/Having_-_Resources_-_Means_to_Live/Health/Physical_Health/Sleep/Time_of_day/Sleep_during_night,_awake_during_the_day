### **Intro**
[//]: <> (BO-intro)
We are daytime creatures â€“ with day versus night being characterized when it is light versus dark outside. It therefore makes sense we all best sleep during the night. Our circadian rhythm is mostly regulated by the amount of light we receive, so that we feel awake during the day and tired when it is dark (1)(2).

### **Why**
[//]: <> (BO-why)

As we are daytime creatures, it makes sense that our nature is built around this.

### *Benefit 1*
Once our body notices that it is getting dark outside, it triggers the production of the sleep hormone called [Melatonin]() (3)(4)(5). When our body then notices that it is getting light outside, we tend to wake up (2). This phase of waking up is facilitated by the production of cortisol (6). Therefore, working together with our natural (circadian) cycle and the sleep and waking hormones that come with it improves your sleep quality.

## **How**
[//]: <> (BO-how)
As we live across the world, where it is light at different times than on other places of the planet, it should be no surprise that there is no absolute baseline circadian rhythm (7).

### *Instruction 1*
The best way to synchronize yourself with this natural light-dark cycle is as follows:
- When you wake up when the sun is already up, immediately go outside for five to ten minutes. This will reset your circadian rhythm by secreting more stress hormone __Cortisol__ (link). It will also push your body to release the sleep hormone __Melatonin__ (link) earlier in the evening (source). This will make you sleepy earlier. Supercharge this effect by also going outside when the sun is setting in the evening (source).
- If you live in an area where it is dark for a relatively long time (for example in winter), you can use a different method. Activate as many bright lights in the morning as possible. This holds especially for overhead lights (source).
- To test the intensity of lights, you can use an application on your phone such as lux. The more lux, the stronger the intensity of light.
