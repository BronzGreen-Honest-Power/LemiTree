## **Intro**
[//]: <> (BO-intro)
Future orientation is the degree to which you are able and willing to sacrifice the present for the future. One major reason why people are poor is because being poor is expensive. You for example cannot invest in resources that decrease future expenses, increase future income or improve your health/energy. Being poor unfortunately forces you to (mostly) focus on surviving in the here and now. Being willing and able to sacrifice today so we may have a better tomorrow is a very old notion that goes back to many ancient civilizations (1) [to-do]. With money, this boils down to spending less than you earn. The degree of future orientation is completely determined by luck and external forces when you are born. However, over time, you have more and more influence over this yourself.

## **Why**
[//]: <> (BO-why)

### *Decrease impact of negative future events*
Spending less than you earn unlocks saving and investing. There will always be unforeseen problems and expenses in the future. Having a growing amount of money on your name makes the negative impact of such future events less problematic at worst and not catastrophic at best.

### *Unlock different positive domains of life*
Having a better financial future orientation enables you to experience more and diverse positive domains of life (1) [to-do] - Maslow's Pyramid. This is because of all the benefits that money provides. Examples include the purchase of food, shelter and physical safety. These are mentioned in the [introduction of money](Intro_money.md).

### *Increased tranquillity*
The more you learn to be content and live with less in the here and now, the easier this attitude will become in the future. This essentialist and minimalist attitude has mental and spiritual benefits as well (1) [to-do] - stuffocation, sense of peace, .

## **How**
[//]: <> (BO-how)
When you are (very) young, your degree of future orientation is dependent on your social safety net. It is your parents, caretakers and/or government providing you with the safety net to explore, play and invest in your future. As you grow older, the safety net of your parents and/or caretakers will naturally decrease. This is where your own responsibility over your future orientation comes in.

### [*Increasing your income*](Generating_money)
### *Decrease your needs*
You can do the following steps in terms of money, energy, time and potentially other domains:
-	Write out all your needs, including of the people you have (voluntarily) taken responsibility for.
- Seek out if you can decrease your (and their) needs, without harming yourself and others in the process.
### *Decrease your wants*
- Investigate if something is a [need or a want](Need_or_want.md).
- [Calculate the long-term value](Calculate_long-term_value.md) of your want.
- Buy it only if the benefits exceed the costs.
### *Write about your future*
Being actively engaged with your own future and your dreams makes the future more real to you. This is the goal of the [Best possible self](../../Best_possible_self.md) tactic.
### *Increase your social safety net*
