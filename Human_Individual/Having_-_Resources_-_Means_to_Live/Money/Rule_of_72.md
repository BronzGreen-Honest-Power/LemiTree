### *Simplify calculations*
Using the rule of 72 makes calculating the time to double very simple. It also shows the power of exponential growth quite easily.

## **How**

### *Rule of 72*
Let's say you know your percentage rate interest. Now, the amount of years it takes for the money (whether a loan or investment) to double is 72 divided by your #% interest rate. Therefore, if you earn 2% interest it takes around 36 years to double your investment. If you pay 8% interest, your loan has doubled in just 9 years. This implies in the same 36 years that instead of 1 double with 2%, you can have 4 doubles with 8%. This means that going from 1000 -> 2000 with 2% compares to 1000 -> 16,000 with 8%.

### *Exact formula*
If you want to have the exact amount of years to double, you have to plug in the amount of interest in the following x: t=ln2/ln(1+x%)
