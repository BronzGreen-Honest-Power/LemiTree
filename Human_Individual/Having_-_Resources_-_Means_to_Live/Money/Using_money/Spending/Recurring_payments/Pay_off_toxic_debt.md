Debt with high interest rates are bloodsuckers. There is also debt with an [acceptable](Acceptable_interest.md) and even [favourable interest rate](Favourable_interest.md). Pay off debt with interest rates higher than 3% as soon as possible. This is because with interest rates higher than 3%, your debt doubles every 24 years or less. Use the [rule of 72](..\Rule_of_72.md) to see the disastrous impact of interest payments than that.  
â†’ Goal: Pay off debt with the highest first until none are left that exceed 3% interest rate (JL Collins)

- Write out all your debt (Dave Ramsey; JL Collins)
- List them from highest to lowest interest rate payment and start paying the first (JL Collins)
