Notes: how - write out what you would like to buy on a list and wait a month -> most likely a want if you don't desperately need it; still could be a valuable want, calculate long-term value of want; this is basically a list of your non-negotiables and your negotiables.
- The more you need/want right now, the more difficult it becomes to become very rich
- The less you need/want right now, the more you can easily have (nearly) everything later
