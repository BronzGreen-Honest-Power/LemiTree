### **Intro**

Passive income is anything that makes you money with minimum to no effort. This subdomain will be the most important for your path towards financial independence. If you don't find a way to make passive income, you will have to rely on working for money your entire life. Very few systems are entirely passive. Some maintenance is generally required. This is why you want to especially choose a passive income that you are intrinsically interested in. This makes the effort required for maintenance pleasurable.
