### **Intro**
[//]: <> (BO-intro)
Welcome to the domain of money. Money is a useful tool to exchange. Money can provide you with the safety, freedom and opportunities to pursue what energizes you. It also allows you to provide these features for your loved ones or society if you choose to. The main popular target within the domain of money is to reach financial independence. This implies you never have to work for money anymore as your systems are working for you. The speed at which you reach financial independence depends on multiple factors. Examples are your [risk tolerance](Risk_tolerance.md) and your degree of [future orientation](Future_orientation.md). You are assumed to have reached financial independence when your [passive income](Passive_income) is greater than your [spending](Spending).
