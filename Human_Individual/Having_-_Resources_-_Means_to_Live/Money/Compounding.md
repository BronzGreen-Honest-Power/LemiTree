## **Intro**
[//]: <> (BO-intro)
Compounding is the term for reinvesting the interest earned on your money. This implies that after a year, you don't only receive interest on your initial investment, but also on the interest you earned in the first year. This might not seem like it's noteworthy, but over time these gains are massive. This is because the increase is exponential. Humans cannot intuitively comprehend how fast exponential growth goes. We generally think linearly. Therefore, we overestimate how much we can get done in a day, but underestimate how much we can get done in a year. The same holds for our money.

## **Why**

### *Doubles game*
Knowing and acting on the principle of compounding gives a different picture of money. It now becomes a doubles game. For example with $1000, you are just 10 doubles away from one million dollars.

### *You can become rich*
Knowledge of the power of compounding makes the journey to financial independence less intimidating. You can now break it down to (small) [monthly contributions](Determine_monthly_investment). This will lead to large results in the long run. It makes spending less than you earn more fun, knowing you will be rich in the future.

## **How**
[//]: <> (BO-how)

We recommend you to play around on the following two websites. This enables you to see how much compounding can mean to you. As a frame of reference, the historic average of the S&P top 500 from 1957 to 2021 has been 10.67% (1). The longer the timespan, the more extreme the results. This is because the power of compounding shows most clearly at the end of the chosen period.

### *Instruction 1*

- Step 1: Fill out how much [starting capital](Starting_capital.md) for investing you have.
- Step 2: Choose the time you have until you are 60 as a first start. This will show you don't need to rely on your countries' [retirement money](Retirement.md) for your financial needs.
- Step 3: Fill out the yearly return rate. 8% is often used as a guideline since it's a bit below the 10.67% mentioned previously. Therefore you are going to more likely to be correct in earning at least this value. Instruction 2 down below gives you a website where you can calculate the historic return rate of the S&P top 500.
- Step 4: Choose continuous compounding as [financial assets](Financial_capital) change value continuously.
- Step 5: Fill out how much money you contribute every month. Look at the tactic of [pay yourself first](Pay_yourself_first.md) to determine how much you can and would like to contribute every month.
- Step 6: Click the green button "Calculate"
- Step 7: Observe and enjoy how realistic becoming financially independent is. The blue part shows your own [starting capital](Starting_capital.md) and monthly contributions. The "Total Interest" or green part of the pie chart shows how much you have earned [passively](Passive_Income).

### *Instruction 2*

The following website shows what average percentage return you would have earned if you would have invested historically in the S&P top 500. These are the 500 largest companies in the United States. Be mindful that past trends cannot be used simply to predict the future. Perhaps the main lesson is that in the long run, the market on average goes up as our society develops.

-	Step 1: Calculate the time you have until you are 60. Choose the starting year by going back that many years from the ending year. For example if you are 30 and the ending year is 2022, plug in 1992 for the starting year.
-	Step 2: If you adjust for inflation, you will see by how much your purchasing power has increased. By not adjusting for inflation, you will see how much your money has increased without taking into account that prices of our products increase.  
- Step 3: Try the same process for different decades. For example 2000-2010 was the worst decade in the past century. This is also why we can't use past results for certain future reference.
- Step 4: By playing around with this calculator, you can clearly observe that the most likely best time to invest was yesterday. Therefore the second best time to invest is today.

Note: For a long time, the S&P top 500 was the most diversified stock index. It traces the biggest 500 companies of the Unites States. If you would like to invest in the stock market with the least amount of risk, we recommend you to look at [investing in the market](Investing_in_the_market.md).
