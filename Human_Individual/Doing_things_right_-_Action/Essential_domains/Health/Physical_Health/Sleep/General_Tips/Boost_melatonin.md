## **Intro**
[//]: <> (BO-intro)
The hormone melatonin plays a crucial role in the sleep/wake cycle (1). Melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland when it is dark (2). This happens to help synchronize our [circadian rhythm](Daily_cycle.md) so that we [sleep at night](Sleep_at_night.md) and are awake during light. The secretion generally happens twelve to fourteen hours after we have been exposed to [bright light](Bright_light_exposure.md) in the morning (source todo).

## **Why**
[//]: <> (BO-why)

### *Benefit 1*
The earlier the onset of melatonin, the more easily you will fall asleep.

### *Benefit 2*
Higher levels of melatonin seems to be "an effective anti-skin aging compound"(3).

### *Benefit 3*
Description of benefit 3.

## **How**
[//]: <> (BO-how)
Melatonin originates amongst others from [serotonin](Serotonin.md)(todo), which itself requires tryptophan. Anything that will boost either of these two, will boost the building blocks for more melatonin and most likely your sleep quality (4).

### *Foods that increase melatonin/serotonin*
* Fruits: Drinking tart cherry juice (5), eating tart cherries (6), eating kiwi fruits (6), pineapple and banana (7)
* Nuts and seeds: Eating pistachio (8), walnuts, shagbark hickory nuts, butternuts (7), white and (less so) black mustard seeds (9)
* Medical herbs: Huang-qin and St. Johnâ€™s Wort (10)

### *Timing of melatonin spike*
* Getting exposed to [bright light](Bright_light_exposure) early in the morning for five to ten minutes causes the melatonin to increase twelve to fourteen hours later. If you wish to sleep earlier, expose yourself to bright light earlier.
* Tactic works great in parallel to stretching or brushing teeth.
