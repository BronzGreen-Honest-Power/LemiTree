# LemiTree-Database

The collection of the best self-development tactics that humanity has to offer is a task that is too big for any of us. We also believe that alone we only know so much, but together we know much more. Therefore we would like to make use of our collective knowledge and resources. To gather the best that humanity has to offer has one great advantage. You won't have to go through endless blogs, videos, articles, books, etcetera where a majority of the '7 secrets to...', 'the 9 habits of ...', are most often the same or stories are long-winded. Here we cut out all the doubles so you are only left with all the concrete tactics you need to make a change in your life. This is why we open-sourced LemiTree. It is made by all of us for all of us. It can therefore become a unique gift that we pass on to our future generations.

## The benefits of this database (why)

At LemiTree, our main intention is to support as many of you to fuel and fulfil your dreams and purpose. Whatever your goals and dreams, having more resources to fulfil them will increase your chances of becoming successful. Knowing yourselves, experiencing more sense of purpose, freedom, energy, time, money, social opportunities, having healed your traumas are some of the many aspects that will help you along your unique journey. This is where LemiTree can be of help. This is also why our essential intent is to support 1 million global citizens self-develop and flourish by 2025

LemiTree is also built to reduce the information overload of the general world wide web. This is because humanity has a lot to offer in terms of information, intentions, news, possibilities, ideas and questions. Unfortunately, the great majority of these do not help you further in reaching your ambitions. Fortunately there are a lot of ideas, tips and tricks that do help you on your journey. Many of these great useful ideas are spread all across the internet. We now wish to bring them all together. This way, you can immediately start experimenting, improving and reach for the stars.

By cutting out as much noise as possible, we just compile the goods. Even with the best intentions, we minimize useful tactics without ads, no 200-page book for 2 tactics, no 6 secrets, 10 habits of ... lists of which the great majority is written about a million times. Focusing purely on signal (not noise), you can now immediately start to improve. Because you save a lot of resources not having to filter through the internet, you can use these resources instead in improving straight away.

The information structure also allows you to curiously browse through different essential domains of life. It prevents you from having to know what to type in, but can just explore. This way you may explore many other subjects you might not have considered otherwise to optimize. Especially for these useful unknown unknowns, this database can serve you well

## Features of this database (how)

- Only actionable tactics that an individual can use will go through the filter

    → Image endless information → filter (only within influence sphere; only for growth; only on domains that are important for all of us; minimized) →  Lemitree [todo]


- We have chosen to open-source, as we believe that together we know more than any of us alone
- Therefore we highly welcome your unique perspective and have enabled you to add:
    - Tactics you have found during research
    - Tactics that have worked for you or for others; some for thousands of years
    - Feedback to add or improve any content on our LemiTree
- This way, this tree of knowledge will remain relevant and act as a great gift for our future (grand-)children

- Instead of restricting sources to purely scientific, we rather just ensure a clear distinction of the level of credibility
- Doing so, users can decide what is convincing enough for them
- This is because it is not up to us to decide other people's values

- In the future, we might add these (and more) features:
    - Having personal accounts, so you can track your progress
    - Enabling you to add periodic tactics to a habit tracker
    - Enabling you to spin a personal wheel of fortune of rewards after successful work
    - Kill branches of your personalized tree that you do not find worthwhile
    - Create communities of people who share many tactics
