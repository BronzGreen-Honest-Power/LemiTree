#Welcome to LemiTree!

Our essential intent is to support 1 million global citizens self-develop and flourish by 2025.
For this purpose, we have created LemiTree.

At LemiTree, you can dive deep in many tactics to improve essential domains of life.
Please use them to make your life as amazing as possible.
It will be the greatest gift you give to you yourself, to your loved ones and to society at large.
You can read the [Introduction LemiTree](Introduction_LemiTree.md) for more information on the what, why and how of our database.

This database is greatly depending on your support for the creation and spread of content.
It is therefore built by and for all of us.
Your support is especially important when you have experience in self-development.
You can read the [Contributor Guide](Contributor_Guide.md) for a few ways you can help our database and mission forward.

If you want, just curiously browse through our tree of knowledge.
Feel free to get started anywhere or share anything interesting with your friends and family.
If you would like some guidance for using our database, you can read the [Recommended pathway into LemiTree](Recommended_pathway_into_LemiTree.md).

The following overview shows the main branches of our Less Effort & More Impact Tree:

Last, there are some important ‘link to Paradigms, Mindset & Disclaimers’ [todo] that are at the foundation for successfully exploiting LemiTree.
Many of these you might already know.
They make for some interesting discussion with your peers.
They also act as an important disclaimer before you get started with the database.

For now, simply experiment, learn and grow from what you find interesting.
Share what works for you and what doesn’t.
Most of all enjoy the progress and your one, unique life.
