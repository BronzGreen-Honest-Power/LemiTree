This recommended pathway is a brief strategy in how to approach your self-development. It then links you with concrete tactics from LemiTree to get started improving yourself. Using this strategy , we wish to initiate short- and long-term virtuous cycles in your life. This strategy will be especially useful if you are new to the scene of self-development. However, your situation is absolutely unique so we cannot give you more than such a starting point (more information on why in the ‘Paradigms, Mindset & Disclaimers’ section).

We start from the principle that your life is yours and yours alone. Therefore, it will be of great use to get to continuously get to know yourself better and take responsibility for your self-care. It is for example only when you feel like your problems are (being) dealt with, that you have the time and space to be there more for others. Living your best possible life is also not the best gift you can give yourself, but also for your loved ones and the world at large. You will namely be able to give more to your surroundings as well as inspire them more.

This pathway recommends you to start with two complementary strategies. They form a great starting point for your self-care and living your best life. The first is very concrete and gives benefits after a short time. The second is more vague and gives much deeper benefits, but only after a longer time.

# **Strategy 1: keystone habits**

Habits are actions we repeat unconsciously on a periodic basis. In general any kind of good habit leads to some meta advantages that give you more space for other good habits. Good habits also tend to crowd out bad habits automatically. Therefore focus mostly on adding good habits. Keystone habits are a subset of habits. Once you live keystone habits, they lead you to be inspired to also improve other aspects of life.

We give you five example keystone habits (there are many more) of which we recommend you only chose one or two to start with. Since we are a creature of habit, it is hard for us to change too much at a time. (More information on habit-building you can find under actions & habits.) Therefore pick any one or two of this list to explore and improve upon:

1. [Habit tracking](Habit_tracking.md)
2. Sleep: [Fixed sleeping time](Fixed_sleeping_time.md)
3. Nourishment: [Meal-prepping](Meal-prepping.md)
4. Movement: [10,000 steps per day](10,000_steps_per_day.md)
5. Money: [Minimize recurring payments](Minimize_recurring_payments.md)

Focus at least one month on any of these subjects and/or tactics to see some measurable progress.

# **Strategy 2: the journey inward**

Living your best possible life and dying without regrets requires you to get to know yourself very well. How could you otherwise live a life according to your expectations (and not those of society) if you don’t?  How well do you for example know your top values, priorities, fears, personality, strengths (and their weaknesses), weaknesses (and their strengths), traumas, paradigms, etcetera? The more you get to know yourself, the better you know to what and whom to say yes and no to. By saying yes to the right things for you, you will get to enjoy life on your terms.

Exploring yourself is a lifelong journey. It is also a path that only you can choose to start or ignore. After all, you are a highly unique, complex and interesting creature. States of internal peace, tranquillity and internal validation are some of the absolutely incredible rewards of this inner journey.

We have compiled many of the questions and tactics to get to know yourself in the following Course - Doing the Right Things. Be curious, dare to face yourself and enjoy living your life more according to your terms, according to who you are.
